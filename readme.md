# Chirp

A modified version of the supporting repo. for Microsoft Virtual Academy's course: [MEAN  Stack Jump Start](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/mean-stack-jump-start-8442) which teaches the MEAN stack by building out a Twitter clone!

## My work

- Upgraded frameworks, libraries and modules to the latest versions
- Fixed documentaion (typos & missing instructions)

## Building Chirp, a MEAN Twitter Clone

We're going to use the whole MEAN stack -- Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node -- to build out a simple but robust Twitter clone called Chirp. 

We're going to show you how to:

- Create a dynamic front end by using the Angular.js front end framework
- Run an server-side application with authentication services on Node.js
- Model and store data in MongoDB
- Build an API using Express

and deploy it all on Azure!

3. [MongoDB](module-4)
4. [Tying the app together in Angular](module-5)
